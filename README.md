## Ansible Configuration

First, you need to install ansible in the computer you will want to use to manage the ansible client (usually, yours)

To do this effectively, you need to run:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
```
